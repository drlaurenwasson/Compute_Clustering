# Introduction to Compute Clustering

From Wikipedia:
"A computer cluster is a set of loosely or tightly connected computers that work together so that, in many respects, they can be viewed as a single system. Unlike grid computers, computer clusters have each node set to perform the same task, controlled and scheduled by software."

Most universities or companies have a high powered computer cluster (or a cloud) to do bioinformatics analysis that would be impossible to do on your home computer. It also allows for streamlined analysis for multiple members of the same lab.

UNC has two clusters: Longleaf and Dogwood.
The difference between the two is that Dogwood seems to be better for "large, multi-node, tightly coupled computational models typically using a message passing (e.g. MPI) or hybrid (OpenMP + MPI) programming model."

Therefore, we are using Longleaf, which seems to be better for our types of analysis.
